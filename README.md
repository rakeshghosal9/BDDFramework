# BDD Framework

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) Framework enables software testers to complete test scripting in plain English. BDD mainly focuses on the behavior of the product and user acceptance criteria.

## Introduction

To implement BDD Framework we have used Cucumber. Cucumber is one of the best tools used to develop in the BDD Framework.It uses Gherkin, an ordinary language parser, that permits writing scripts in English that can be easily understood. It is used to run the acceptance tests written in BDD.

## Technical Details

To run the project you need to have at least Java 8 and Maven 3.3.9 installed on your system.

Just run the Maven command ```mvn clean verify``` to see the runner and feature generation of Cucable in action.

The runner and feature files are generated inside the `target` directory.
