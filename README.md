# BDD Framework

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) Framework enables software testers to complete test scripting in plain English. BDD mainly focuses on the behavior of the product and user acceptance criteria.To implement BDD Framework we have used Cucumber. Cucumber is one of the best tools used to develop in the BDD Framework.It uses Gherkin, an ordinary language parser, that permits writing scripts in English that can be easily understood. It is used to run the acceptance tests written in BDD.
